# Project - Smart Recommender

## Description / How it works

1) After getting the JSON output of the products with Fetch API, the products were added to the created HTML elements.

2) Products appear 5 by 5 in Desktop size. It has a responsive feature. As the screen gets smaller, the number of products shown is decreasing by one. Only 1 product appears in the Mobile view.

3) It has been made so that the number of product-cards in the product-container remains constant when the right or left button is pressed.

4) In addition, some parsed products did not have price information. This was remedied by not showing the non-existing price but indeed showing **Out of stock** text on the product price information.
